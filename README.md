Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung

Welcome to the development site of LungMAP CellRefs, single cell references with comprehensive and well-defined cell types for both human and mouse lungs. 

The LungMAP CellRefs v1 were constructed using a new guided computational pipeline that utilized the [LungMAP CellCards](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(21)00892-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580721008923%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) as a cell type dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples and identified 48 human and 40 mouse well-defined lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points. Please see details in the CellRef [preprint]().

Web interfaces to LungMAP CellRefs:

- LGEA CellRef interfaces: https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/CellRef/LungMapCellRef.html
- LungMAP CellRef Azimuth instances: https://app.lungmap.net/app/azimuth-lung-cell-cards-human
- LungMAP CellRef ShinyCell apps: https://app.lungmap.net/app/shinycell-lung-cellcards-human-mnn
- LungMAP CellCards: https://lungmap.net/cell-cards/

Please note that the LungMAP CellRef Azimuth instance and ShinyCell apps are currently hosting an early version of the LungMAP Human Lung CellRef Seed and CellRef. We are updating the data to LungMAP CellRef and CellRef Seed v1.
