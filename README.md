Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung

Welcome to the development site of LungMAP CellRefs, single cell references with comprehensive and well-defined cell types for both human and mouse lungs. 

The LungMAP CellRefs v1 were constructed using a new guided computational pipeline that utilized the [LungMAP CellCards](https://www.cell.com/developmental-cell/fulltext/S1534-5807(21)00892-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1534580721008923%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) as a cell type dictionary to consolidate single-cell transcriptomic datasets of 104 human lungs and 17 mouse lung samples and identified 48 human and 40 mouse well-defined lung cell types catalogued from diverse anatomic locations and developmental time points. Please see details in the CellRef [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.18.491687v1).
